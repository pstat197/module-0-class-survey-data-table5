## Results

To explore whether students’ preferences for project type and programming language vary depending on prior research experience, we conducted two chi-squared tests of independence.

### Project Type Preference

A chi-squared test examined the association between students’ prior research experience and their preferred project type (Industry, Lab, or Both).  
The result was **not statistically significant**, χ²(2) = 0.13, *p* = 0.94, indicating that students with and without prior research experience showed **similar distributions of project preferences**.  
In other words, research experience does not appear to influence whether students prefer working on an industry or lab-based project.

### Programming Language Preference

A second chi-squared test assessed the relationship between prior research experience and preferred programming language (Python, R, or mixed preferences).  
This test was also **not significant**, χ²(3) = 1.42, *p* = 0.70, suggesting that **students’ programming language preferences are independent of their research experience**.

### Summary of Findings

| Test | χ² | df | p-value | Interpretation |
|------|:--:|:--:|:--------:|----------------|
| Project Type vs. Research Experience | 0.13 | 2 | 0.94 | No significant relationship |
| Programming Language vs. Research Experience | 1.42 | 3 | 0.70 | No significant relationship |

### Interpretation

Across both tests, the p-values were well above 0.05, indicating **no evidence of dependence** between prior research experience and either project or language preference.  
This suggests that students’ project and language choices are **likely influenced by factors other than research experience**, such as coursework, personal interest, or perceived career applicability.  
From a practical perspective, this finding implies that offering a range of project types and languages can accommodate students effectively, regardless of their prior research involvement.
